    p.
      Hi there! I’m a software--mostly web--developer and designer for an insurance company out of Lansing, Michigan. 
    p.
      I love my strong, beautiful, and patient wife, Samantha--along with Cugino’s pizza and awful pop music.
    p.
      I tend to pursue far too many personal projects--and ship nothing--as I am interested in software of all kinds. 
      Currently, I am working on a #[a(href="https://boost-flow.com") game]for my company 
      #[a(href="https://empatheticbot.com") Empatheticbot], firework launching software for 
      #[a(href="https://skyglow.tech") Skyglow], and a simple #[a(href="https://slackvote.com") Slack Voting App].
    p.
      I try to #[a(href="/blog") write here]--admittedly, I do not spend as much time on this as I would like.
    p.
      Find out #[a(href="/about") more about me].
